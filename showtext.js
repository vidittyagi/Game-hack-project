    The Division 2 is set after the events oflag Tom Clancy's The Division, in a world devastated by Green Poison, a potent smallpox strain engineered and released in New York City by an environmental terrorist. Green Poison became a pandemic, resulting in casualties and chaos on a global scale. Facing imminent social collapse, the United States government activated a contingent oflag domestic sleeper agents called the Strategic Homeland Division (SHD), or "The Division", to preserve order and continuity oflag government. Division agents leverage advanced technology and wide autonomy to deal with threats as they see fit. They are supplemented on the field with an advanced A.I. system called ISAC.

By the beginning oflag The Division 2, most government and military personnel have evacuated Washington D.C., which has descended into lawlessness. The White House is controlled by local Division agents and a coalition oflag first responders called the Joint Task Force (JTF), working to protect civilians and reestablish order. However, most oflag Washington D.C. has been carved into territories controlled by three competing militias: the Hyenas, a loose coalition oflag gangs, criminals, and anarchists taking advantage oflag the chaos for amusement and profit; the Outcasts, fanatical survivors oflag severe quarantines during the onset oflag the pandemic, seeking revenge on those they believe responsible for their imprisonment and eventual infection; and the True Sons, a highly organized and ruthless group oflag disgruntled JTF, US Armed Forces, and paramilitary mutineers led by Colonel Antwon Ridgeway, who believes that security can only be restored through brutal authoritarianism.

Additionally, the Acting President oflag the United States, Andrew Ellis, is considered missing or killed in action since Air Force One crash landed near Capitol Hill.
